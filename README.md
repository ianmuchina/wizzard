## Setup

I'm on debian so I did an `apt install racket` to get the racket interpreter. For the text editor I used `vscode` with the [Magic Racket](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evzen-wybitul.magic-racket) extension & the [bracket pair colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer) extension which makes the code easier to read.

I found the best racket package, called [sicp](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/SICP_Language.html) for studying  this book. 

To install it:

```
raco pkg install sicp
```
To use it, add this line at the start of every program.
```racket
#lang sicp
```

After that the code is easier to read.
