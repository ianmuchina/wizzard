# Exercise 1.4: 
## Question
Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions. 
Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

```scheme
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
```
Pretty printed
```scheme
(if (> b 0) ; Predicate
 	+ ; Consequent 
 	- ; Alternative)
```

## Answer

Here is the leftmost operator. It's an `if` expression. Depending on the inputs, it returns either a 

* `+`  plus procedure 
*  `-` minus procdure

The actual conditions are 

+ if b is a positive number, use the add procedure on b and a `(+ b a)`
+ if b is a negative number, use the minus procedure on b and a `(- b a)`

## Thoughts

I think the question is meant to introduce us to procedures can return procedures. This concept was mentioned a little in the video lectures  and called them higher order procedures.
