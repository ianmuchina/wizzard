# 1. Building Abstractions with Procedures

Quote from 1690 about abstraction:

>  We humans do 3 with ideas:
> 1. Combine simple ones into complex ones
> 2. Compare ideas with each other
> 3. Abstract *(Simplify)* complicated ones

The first chapter starts with a philosophical take on the computer process. It's compared with a spirit. It lives inside the computer. It can't be touched or seen, but very real. It is able to think in it's own special way. It controls important parts of our lives and can have a huge impact on the world. 

This observation from 1985 still holds true.

Learning to write programs is like learning how to write spells. You learn slowly how to command the spirit that lives inside the computer. You must be able to predict the effects what you conjure. Small mistakes can have unexpected errors. They are not dangerous in a learning environment. However,  errors in real world programs, nowadays called production code can lead to catastrophic effects. 

Of course The expert software *engineers*  know how to handle the errors.

## LISP

The language used in the book is `LISP` . The name Is an acronym for LISt Processing. It's an old language from 1950 *(only Fortran is older)*. It has lots of versions/dialects & it keeps on evolving.

It's not a mainstream language. However the authors say it's the best language to teach sicp. They gave some reasons but I don't  quite get it yet. You can write compilers & interpreters in LISP so this should be fun.

## Quotes

The key to understanding complicated things is to know what not to look at, what not to compute and what not to think. [Lecture 1B](https://youtu.be/V_7mmwpgJHU?t=597)

Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.
