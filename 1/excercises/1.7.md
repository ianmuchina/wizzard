## Exercise 1.7:

The good-enough? test used in computing square roots will not be very effective for finding the square roots of small numbers. Also, in real computers, arithmetic operations are almost always performed with limited precision. This makes our test inadequate for large numbers.

Explain these statements, with examples showing how the test fails for small and large numbers.

An alternative strategy for implementing `good-enough` is to watch how guess changes from one iteration to the next and to stop when the change is a very small fraction of the guess.

TASK: Design a square-root procedure that uses this kind of end test. Does this work better for small and large numbers?

## Thoughts



## Answer

Recursive procedures needs a base cases to exit. Our square root procedure is recursive but it has a problematic base case. Comparison between floats. Floats are weird and they aren't accurate. The solution would be to compare if the change between negative or zero. (Or have more accurate floats??)

The solution is to watch the changes between guesses. I think stopping once the changes stop since they can't be represented in floating-point is a better test since we stop doing infinite repeated math.

I think checking the difference between 2 guesses accounts for 2 things:

1. When the precise answer is found
2. When the precise answer is not found and the computer reaches the limit of what it can realistically represent.
