# Exercise 1.5
## Question
Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is faced with is using:

* Applicative-order evaluation or 
* Normal-order evaluation. 

He defines the following two procedures:
```scheme
(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y) 
  (if (= x 0) 
      0 
      y))
```

Then he evaluates the expression

```scheme
(test 0 (p))
```

What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation? 

What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation? 

## Answer

Procedure `p` is infinite and will never evaluate. Evaluating zero on the other hand is instant. These 2 are are used to test if an interpreter uses applicative or normal order. 

If it's instant, the interpreter is speedrunning the evaluation of the code and only interpreting arguments on demand. If the interpterter takes forever, it has expanded every argument untill it returns sth. 

Referring to the book this is normal order evaluation.
> The “fully expand and then reduce” evaluation method is known as normal-order evaluation
