# Exercise 1.6

Alyssa P. Hacker doesn’t see why if needs to be provided as a special form. "Why
can’t I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms of cond?" she asks.
Alyssa’s friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she defines a
new version of if:

```scheme
(define (new-if predicate
                then-clause
                else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))
```

Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:

```scheme
(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)
;5

(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)
;0
```

Delighted, Alyssa uses new-if to rewrite the square-root program:

```scheme
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
```

What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots? Explain.

## Answer

The process will continue infinitely. Here's why:

Earlier in the book, the `if` keyword is included among the special forms. `define` is also special form.

However, procedures returned by the `define` or `lambda` keyword are not special forms. They are evaluated using applicative order by the interpreter.

This is where the problem comes in. Recursive procedures all need a base case, written as if statements. These base cases are needed to prevent infinite loops.

The new-if procedure works fine on procedures that aren't recursive. The new-if is not a special form. This makes it run forever if the substitution model is used.

This is the same problem faced in Excercise 1.5.
